*UCB Data Analysis Bootcamp Challenge 9*
# SQL-Challenge
---------------
#### Purpose:
As a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (hereafter "PH") my first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files which I will use here to perform data modeling, data engineering and data analysis.
